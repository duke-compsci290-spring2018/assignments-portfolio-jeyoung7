The two different CSS files, style.css and styletwo.css are a drastic departure

style.css tries a format that should be painful to look at. It is flooded with GIFS and weird text combos.
In addition the format puts text closely together and has a weird side bar which was from teh csszen template.


styletwo.css is a traditional old fashion web-paged. It has a rigid structure and keeps its focus on readability and
 understanding what is presnted in the site. The color scheme is bearable and it is not too out there.
 
Overall, though, I learned a great deal on formatting sites and creating them further.
It helped me especially get better at positioning and formatting
with large classes.
