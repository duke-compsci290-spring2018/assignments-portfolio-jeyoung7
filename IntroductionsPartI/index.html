<h2>Autobiography</h2>
<p>
    Jacob Young started to use a computer at age 4. He would play addictingGames.com at his dad's office and listen to Hey Ya.
    He has used a Windows XP desktop from early 2000's, Macbook from 2006, Toshiba from 2009, and a rotation of Macbook Pros since.
    He enjoys surfing Wikipedia pages, reading the Economist online, and watching Spanish netflix shows. Unlike a Computer Scientist, who likely
    spends his or her day researching ways to improve the structure of the internet, he takes it as granted and enjoys the black box of the
    world wide web.

    He decided to study Computer Science his freshman year of college. He had always had an interest in the mystic life oa a hacker/programmer and develop.er
    Yet, Jacob thought he would do the familiar law path and hold the line, but realized he enjoyed development and making stuff. It is why
    he is studying Computer Science. He took CS 290 as a way to build Web dev. experience. He has some experience with Mobile dev, but really needs the structured approach
    to understand the mess called Web development.

    The reason Web development is weird is the abundance of languages and scripts. To create and style the website, you need to know HTML and CSS.
    But to make those elements do anything, you need a little Javascript to throw in the pot. In addition, for further work with Databases, you may choose
    a Ruby or PHP backend. Then, adding in the design, you may need to know Sketch, Photoshop, Illustrator and a lot more!

    In the future, Jacob hopes to use a computer to manage a team of programmers under him and to contribtue to code, prototypes, marketing, and business plans at his own company. He hopes
    he can rely on a lot more paper, however, and would like his screentime limited.
