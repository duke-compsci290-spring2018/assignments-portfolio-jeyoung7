        <p>
            Jacob Young started to use a computer at age 4. He would play addictingGames.com at his dad's office and listen to
            Hey Ya.
            He has used a Windows XP desktop from early 2000's, Macbook from 2006, Toshiba from 2009, and a rotation of Macbook
            Pros since.
            He enjoys surfing Wikipedia pages, reading the Economist online, and watching Spanish netflix shows. Unlike a
            Computer Scientist, who likely
            spends his or her day researching ways to improve the structure of the internet, he takes it as granted and enjoys
            the black box of the
            world wide web.

            He decided to study Computer Science his freshman year of college. He had always had an interest in the mystic life
            oa a hacker/programmer and develop.er
            Yet, Jacob thought he would do the familiar law path and hold the line, but realized he enjoyed development and
            making stuff. It is why
            he is studying Computer Science. He took CS 290 as a way to build Web dev. experience. He has some experience with
            Mobile dev, but really needs the structured approach
            to understand the mess called Web development.

            The reason Web development is weird is the abundance of languages and scripts. To create and style the website, you
            need to know HTML and CSS.
            But to make those elements do anything, you need a little Javascript to throw in the pot. In addition, for further
            work with Databases, you may choose
            a Ruby or PHP backend. Then, adding in the design, you may need to know Sketch, Photoshop, Illustrator and a lot
            more!

            In the future, Jacob hopes to use a computer to manage a team of programmers under him and to contribtue to code,
            prototypes, marketing, and business plans at his own company. He hopes
            he can rely on a lot more paper, however, and would like his screentime limited.
