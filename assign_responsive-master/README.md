# assign_responsive
An example HTML file of data to be styled responsively using Bootstrap

I created a grid of photos that easily adjusted into a small view. It goes from 4 columns to one column and resizes images, text, and formats to make it look prettier.
In addition, I reformmated the navbar and redid that as well. I also changed the background colors depending on screern size, but it was focused on transitions
from small to large and medium to large. The color scheme was also redone. I will admit it is not beautiful,
but it looks the right format on many screens.
