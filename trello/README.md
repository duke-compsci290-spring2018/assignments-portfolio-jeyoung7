Other Info:
This is the finished Trello. I turned it in late to add extra functionality such as the activity log and add styling.
The challenges implemented are: Make any number comments on a card, View Project Activities, add multiple assignees to a card.
I put a ton of effort into the functionality side, CSS side lesser so. But, I believe it is decent looking and definitely took some effort to get it here.

For the functionality:
Brief walk through to get started:

1. Sign Up
2. Sign In  (no authentication)
3. Add Category 
4. Add a List
5. Add New post
6. View 
- click on card to see it enlarged, to edit it, to add comments, images , etc.. 
- click button menu to change category 
- click color button to change things up
7. View activity
below cards click view activity to see the activity log
