# assign_game

A simple rendition of breakout using javascript.
I built a classic breakout game with a few cheat codes, such as expanding paddles, or contracting paddles, and adding lives. 
I used the pong game as a boiler plate and built on top of it. I added bricks to draw, and a varierty of additional methods to improve the game.
Overall, I learned a lot about how javascript works with html and how to optimize it within the constraints of time.
