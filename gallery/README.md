# Gallery

This is a basic gallery. It is completely dynamic, and through clicking the boxes you can limit down the selection. 
If you want to limit to category based on photo clicked you can click on the image that is large. The gallery can also be refreshed so you have the old gallery back.

Note:
If you click on the image, that is enlarged to get a category, to get other photos you need to click and unclick whichever checkboxes are there. 
Also, the categories might only make sense to me. 


To enter one category slideshow mode, click on showAll and you will see a 
new slideshow with one category per filling. To go back to normal mode, click not category mode.
